## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-02 — Public skills library, unified search, weekly logs

### Added — Public skills library

- New `/skills` route renders all 71 Claude Code skills authored across Benmore engagements as a browsable, copy-for-LLM index.
- `content/skills/*.md` is the source of truth — flat directory of 71 skill markdown files (lessons, system prompts, scripts) loaded server-side via `lib/skills.ts` (`fs` + `gray-matter`).
- `app/skills/page.tsx` — server-rendered list, filtered by category via `<SkillsClient>` (client-only filter UI; data is server-fetched).
- `app/skills/[slug]/page.tsx` — per-skill detail page with rendered body, line count, category, and a `<SkillCopyButton>` ("Copy for LLM") that streams the raw markdown to clipboard.
- `app/skills/[slug]/raw/route.ts` — plain-text endpoint at `/skills/<slug>/raw` returning the raw markdown with `text/plain; charset=utf-8`. Unauthenticated, cacheable, designed to be `curl`-able and pasteable into any LLM.
- `app/skills.json/route.ts` — JSON index of all skills (slug, name, description, category, lineCount) for programmatic discovery and crawler hints.
- `lib/skills.ts` — single loader. Categorization via regex rules (Payments, Python Backend, Frontend & Apps, Compliance & Security, SEO & AI, Design Engineering, Product & Discovery, Workflow & Ops, Tooling & Integrations, Misc).
- LLM install instructions surfaced on each skill page; references to the public `skills.sh` install script (replaces per-skill GitHub link).
- Page-tour screenshots committed under `docs/screenshots/final/` (01–09 covering home, about, experience, projects, research, writing, learnings, skill-detail, media).
- `app/sitemap.ts` enumerates `/skills` + every `/skills/[slug]` route.
- `public/llms.txt` updated to advertise `/skills.json` and `/skills/<slug>/raw` endpoints to AI crawlers.
- Benmore badge (`components/ui/BenmoreBadge.tsx`) lives on `/skills` only — moved out of nav to keep main chrome neutral.

### Added — Unified search on `/writing`

- `app/writing/WritingIndexClient.tsx` rewritten to search across **essays + knowledge-domain articles** in one input. Tag filter pills run alongside the search input; results merge writing entries and knowledge entries with source-type badges.
- `/learnings` content folded into `/writing` (the standalone `/learnings` route is being retired as the primary surface).

### Added — Projects search + tag filter + pagination

- `app/projects/ProjectsClient.tsx` — search box, tag filter collapsed to **top 8 tags + "+N more" expander**, paginated grid, and `WORK_TOOLS` (internal CLIs from `/work`) folded into the same surface so Foundry / RTK / Compound Skills / Excalidraw appear next to public projects.
- `app/projects/page.tsx` slimmed to a server shell that delegates to the client component.

### Added — Home page rewiring

- Skills card on the homepage promoting `/skills` (replaces the prior Knowledge two-up).
- "Recent wins" rail and Featured-banner support for surfacing the latest highlight.
- "Second brain" section removed from home and from `/writing` (folded into the unified search experience).

### Added — `/weekly` running logs

- New `/weekly` route renders ISO-week running logs sourced from `content/weekly/` (MDX) and `lib/weekly.ts` (typed loader).
- `lib/highlights.ts` — typed data bank for "highlights of the week"; consumed by the home Recent Wins rail and `/weekly`.
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-05-02-004-feat-weekly-logs-and-data-bank-plan.md`.

### Changed — Navigation

- `lib/site.ts` `NAV_LINKS` updated: `/skills` and `/writing` (with merged learnings) added/promoted; `/knowledge` demoted to secondary.
- Benmore badge removed from `<Nav>`; only renders on `/skills`.

### Changed — Timeline avatars

- `components/sections/TimelineItem.tsx` — avatars bumped to **36 px**, monogram fallback when no logo is available, `bg-elevated` background, consistent ring treatment across major and minor entries.

### Docs

- New plans:
  - `docs/plans/2026-05-02-003-feat-llm-copy-and-skills-public-plan.md` — design + rollout for the public skills library and "Copy for LLM" affordances.
  - `docs/plans/2026-05-02-004-feat-weekly-logs-and-data-bank-plan.md` — `/weekly` route + highlights data bank.
- Release note: `docs/release-notes/2026-05-02-skills-library.md`.

### Build

- `package.json` version bumped 2.3.0 → 2.4.0.
- Recommended git tag: `v2.4.0`.

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-27 — Asset consolidation, mobile, Trustpilot, GitHub live charts

### Added — Live GitHub activity section on the homepage

- New `components/sections/GitHubActivity.tsx` rendering:
  - Live 12-month contribution heatmap (`ghchart.rshah.org`) — horizontal-scrollable inside an `overflow-x-auto` wrapper on mobile
  - Live stats card, current streak, top languages (`github-readme-stats.vercel.app`, `streak-stats.demolab.com`) themed to the Metior-Pro palette (mint primary `#5EEAD4`, warm-tan accent `#F4A66A`)
  - Personal commit-tracker snapshot from `public/images/receipts/github-activity.png` plus structured snapshot table (30d, 7d, active days, raw lines, adjusted output)
- Wired into `app/page.tsx` between Projects and Tools+Knowledge sections.

### Added — Real Trustpilot screenshots on `/media`

- `Review` type extended with `reviewer`, `date`, `excerpt`, `image`.
- 5 reviewers (Jim Watkins, Jack Frisbie, Daniel Adewumi, Brad Pierce, Allan Bell) shown as image-cards with `<Image>` (`fill`, `aspect-[4/3]`, `object-top`); each card links to the live Trustpilot page.
- Remaining 5 reviews kept as compact link list under `+ N more verified reviews`.
- Replaces the synthetic "Verified Benmore engagement" placeholder boxes flagged in design feedback.
- Receipts folder renamed `public/images/reciepts/` → `public/images/receipts/`; macOS-screenshot filenames (with NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE) renamed to clean kebab-case.

### Added — Cover-letter response doc

- `docs/cover-letters/2026-04-keith-liston-o1-response.md` — point-by-point evidence inventory mapping to all 8 USCIS O-1A criteria. Private working draft (folder excluded from `lib/docs.ts` so it is not served by the website).

### Changed — Hero stat box

- Replaced `887% Revenue Growth` stat with `6+ Years Tech Experience` per design feedback (the work-history claim was misleading on a public landing surface).

### Changed — Real X / Twitter handle

- `lib/site.ts`: `https://x.com/_arkash` → `https://x.com/ArkashJ__` (the prior handle 404'd).

### Changed — Mobile responsiveness

- Added `min-w-0` to grid items in the STU STREET disclosure list, the link-only Trustpilot list, the Medium articles list, and the Press list. Without `min-w-0`, CSS Grid items default to `min-width: auto` and refuse to truncate, which was producing **343 px of horizontal overflow** on `/media` at a 375 px viewport.
- Verified via Playwright at iPhone 13 Pro width (375 × 812): all 13 public routes (`/`, `/about`, `/research`, `/experience`, `/projects`, `/work`, `/writing`, `/knowledge`, `/coursework`, `/credentials`, `/stack`, `/learnings`, `/architecture`) report `documentWidth ≤ viewportWidth`.

### Changed — GitHub profile README (separate repo)

- `ArkashJ/ArkashJ`: rewrote profile README to reflect the current Benmore role, 4 published papers, real social handles, and live `github-readme-stats` widgets. Old README still claimed "Currently I'm building a UNet architecture for Image Segmentation" — that work was published months ago.

### Changed — Image consolidation

- All site images consolidated under `public/images/`:
  - `public/myImg.jpeg` → `public/images/profile.jpeg`
  - `public/logos/*.svg` → `public/images/logos/*.svg`
  - `public/files/*.pdf` → `public/images/files/*.pdf`
  - 37 unused legacy logos/JPGs at `public/` root → `public/images/legacy/`
- Updated all source references:
  - `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/about/archive/page.tsx` — profile import path
  - `lib/structured-data.ts`, `lib/metadata.ts` — Person JSON-LD + OG fallback URLs
  - `components/ui/InstitutionLogo.tsx` — institution logo URLs
  - `app/credentials/page.tsx`, `lib/data.ts` — verifiable credential PDF URLs
- 58 dev/walkthrough screenshots at repo root → `docs/screenshots/`
- `public/` root now contains only: `favicon.svg`, `images/`, `timeline/`, `llms*.txt`, `humans.txt`, `robots.txt`, and verification keys (Google, IndexNow)
- `.gitignore`: added `!public/**/*.png` exception so consolidated images at `public/images/legacy/` are tracked.

### Changed — Documentation

- **`CLAUDE.md`** rewritten end-to-end. Old version still described the legacy Next 13 Pages Router site with three pages and "lint errors are ignored". New version reflects the App Router + TypeScript-strict architecture, the actual route table, the `lib/` data layer, the MDX content tree, and the new image conventions.
- **`README.md`** rewritten as a comprehensive author dossier — full life timeline, credentials, publications, knowledge domains, internal tools, repo tree, stack, links, badges. Goes well beyond a project-only README to consolidate the website's content into a single Markdown reference.

### Build

- Production build passes after the move. `npm run lint` clean (4 pre-existing warnings unrelated to this change). `npm run format:check` passes.
- `package.json` version bumped 1.0.0 → 2.3.0 to align with CHANGELOG.

---

## [2.3.0-prev] — 2026-04-26 — Initial 2.3 draft (superseded)

### Changed — Single image location

- All site images consolidated under `public/images/`:
  - `public/myImg.jpeg` → `public/images/profile.jpeg`
  - `public/logos/*.svg` → `public/images/logos/*.svg`
  - `public/files/*.pdf` → `public/images/files/*.pdf`
  - 37 unused legacy logos/JPGs at `public/` root → `public/images/legacy/`
- Updated all source references:
  - `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/about/archive/page.tsx` — profile import path
  - `lib/structured-data.ts`, `lib/metadata.ts` — Person JSON-LD + OG fallback URLs
  - `components/ui/InstitutionLogo.tsx` — institution logo URLs
  - `app/credentials/page.tsx`, `lib/data.ts` — verifiable credential PDF URLs
- 58 dev/walkthrough screenshots at repo root → `docs/screenshots/`
- `public/` root now contains only: `favicon.svg`, `images/`, `timeline/`, `llms*.txt`, `humans.txt`, `robots.txt`, and verification keys (Google, IndexNow)

### Changed — Documentation

- **`CLAUDE.md`** rewritten end-to-end. Old version still described the legacy Next 13 Pages Router site with three pages and "lint errors are ignored". New version reflects the App Router + TypeScript-strict architecture, the actual route table, the `lib/` data layer, the MDX content tree, and the new image conventions.
- **`README.md`** rewritten as a comprehensive author dossier — full life timeline, credentials, publications, knowledge domains, internal tools, repo tree, stack, links, badges. Goes well beyond a project-only README to consolidate the website's content into a single Markdown reference.

### Build

- Production build passes after the move. No code-level behavior changes.
